# Verible

The Verible project's main mission is to parse SystemVerilog (IEEE 1800-2017)
for a wide variety of applications.

It was born out of a need to parse *un-preprocessed* source files, which is
suitable for single-file applications like style-linting and formatting. In
doing so, it can be adapted to parse *preprocessed* source files, which is what
real compilers and toolchains require.

The spirit of the project is that no-one should ever have to develop a
SystemVerilog parser for their own application, because developing a
standard-compliant parser is an enormous task due to the syntactic complexity of
the language.

A lesser (but notable) objective is that the language-agnostic components of
Verible be usable for rapidly developing language support tools for other
languages.
